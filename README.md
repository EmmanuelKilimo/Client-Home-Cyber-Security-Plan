                                  Home Cyber Security: A Capstone Project for Securing Jane Doe
    
This repository contains the documentation for a capstone project focused on providing a comprehensive cyber security consultation for a residential client. The project's objective was to act as a cyber consultant for Jane Doe, the CEO of a boutique cybersecurity firm, and deliver a practical, professional cybersecurity plan tailored to her home network and family's digital life.

A central challenge of this project was to provide a "white-glove," seamless solution that would be robust and professional, yet easy for her family to use without constant technical intervention.
      
     Client Profile & Key Concerns
    
The project was driven by the client's unique profile and specific goals:

•	Client: Jane Doe, an expert in cybersecurity who, for this engagement, was acting purely as a homeowner seeking proactive hardening of her digital environment.

•	Urgency: Medium. The goal was to build a fortress against threats that might target security professionals and their families.

•	Family: A spouse, two teenagers, and a frequently visiting aunt, all with varying levels of technical skill and digital needs.

  •	Stated Goals:
  
        o	Network Segmentation: To isolate high-risk devices like smart cameras and gaming consoles from her work laptop.

        o	Family Security: To implement simple yet effective online safety rules and a user-friendly password management strategy.

        o	Privacy: To minimize data collection from a wide array of smart home devices, including TVs and a Facebook Portal.

  Project Process & Deliverables

This project followed a full-cycle client engagement process, beginning with an assessment of the client's extensive digital assets—from multiple computers and phones to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and IoT devices like Blink cameras and Nest thermostats.
The final output is a Client Security Packet, which consolidates the following items into a single, professionally formatted document:

•	Threat Profile: A detailed analysis of potential cyber threats tailored to the client's specific family structure and technological footprint.

•	Digital Asset Inventory: A structured table listing all digital devices and services that require protection.

•	Personalized Cybersecurity Plan: The core recommendations, providing a clear and simple explanation of the necessary actions, including:

o	Firewall and network segmentation strategies for her Eero Pro 6 mesh network.

o	Endpoint security recommendations.

o	A robust data backup and recovery plan.

o	An identity and password management strategy for the entire family.

o	Recommendations for enhancing privacy on smart devices.

•	Proposed Home Network Map: A logical diagram illustrating the recommended future-state network configuration.
